# Data-Mining
School Project 
In this work, we consider the task of identifying stroke
patient from patientâ€™s history. Predicting patient with a
stroke can be simply considered as a binary classification
problem where the algorithm predicts if a patient has stroke
or not. We use the publicly available stroke prediction
dataset [1] from kaggle1.
